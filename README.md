# CIFAR-10-NeuralNet
Simple Neural Network trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Built to imagine images based on categories but now used to classify.

## Neural network
Based on the book 'Make your own Neural Network' by Tariq Rashid. This Neural Network has an extra hidden layer. The setup is:
- Input: 3072
- Hidden l1: 1500
- Hidden l2: 500
- Output: 10

Learning rate: 0.1

The settings can be adjusted easily.
